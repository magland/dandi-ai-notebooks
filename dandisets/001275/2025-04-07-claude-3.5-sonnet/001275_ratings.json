In particular, the contents seem to relate to the task design (navigation between landmarks on a linear track) and the type of neural recordings (electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex). This aligns more with a score of 6 than a score of 5, as it also describes the overall purpose (mental navigation task) in addition to the ID/title and overviews.
