# **NOTE: This notebook was AI-generated using dandi-notebook-gen and has not been fully verified. Please be cautious when interpreting the code or results.**
#
# This notebook demonstrates how to access and analyze data from a primate mental navigation task where subjects performed mental navigation between landmarks on a linear track.
#
# ## Required Packages
#
# Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:
# - pynwb
# - lindi
# - numpy
# - matplotlib
# - seaborn

# %%
import pynwb
import lindi
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# %% [markdown]
# ## Loading the Dataset
# 
# First, let's use the DANDI API to list all assets in the dataset:

# %%
from dandi.dandiapi import DandiAPIClient
client = DandiAPIClient()
dandiset = client.get_dandiset("001275")
assets = list(dandiset.get_assets())

# Print basic information about available files
print("Available NWB files:")
for asset in assets:
    print(f"- {asset.path}")

# %% [markdown]
# For this analysis, we'll work with one behavior+ecephys file. This file contains both behavioral data and neural recordings from the task.

# %%
# Load the NWB file
f = lindi.LindiH5pyFile.from_lindi_file("https://lindi.neurosift.org/dandi/dandisets/001275/assets/b0bbeb4c-5e0d-4050-a993-798173797d94/nwb.lindi.json")
nwb = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=f, mode='r').read()

# Display basic session information
print("Session Information:")
print(f"Subject ID: {nwb.subject.subject_id}")
print(f"Session Date: {nwb.session_start_time}")
print(f"Task Description: {nwb.session_description}")

# ## Behavioral Data Analysis
#
# The task involves mental navigation between landmarks on a linear track. Subjects are presented with start and target landmarks, and after a delay, they must use a joystick to navigate to the target landmark without visual feedback.
#
# Let's analyze different aspects of behavioral performance:

# %%
# Get trials data
trials = nwb.intervals["trials"]
trial_types = trials["trial_type"][:]  # 1=NTS (visible), 3=MNAV (occluded)
success = trials["succ"][:]
rt = trials["rt"][:]
start_pos = trials["curr"][:]
target_pos = trials["target"][:]
distances = np.abs(target_pos - start_pos)

# Plot trial type distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
trial_type_counts = np.bincount(trial_types.astype(int))[1:]
plt.bar(['NTS', 'Center Visible', 'MNAV'], trial_type_counts)
plt.title('Distribution of Trial Types')
plt.ylabel('Number of Trials')
plt.show()

# Plot success rates by trial type
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
success_by_type = [np.mean(success[trial_types == i]) for i in [1, 2, 3]]
plt.bar(['NTS', 'Center Visible', 'MNAV'], success_by_type)
plt.title('Success Rate by Trial Type')
plt.ylabel('Success Rate')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.show()

# Plot success rate vs distance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
dist_bins = np.linspace(0, np.max(distances), 6)
dist_centers = (dist_bins[1:] + dist_bins[:-1]) / 2
success_by_dist = []
for i in range(len(dist_bins)-1):
    mask = (distances >= dist_bins[i]) & (distances < dist_bins[i+1])
    success_by_dist.append(np.mean(success[mask]))

plt.plot(dist_centers, success_by_dist, 'o-')
plt.title('Success Rate vs Distance Between Landmarks')
plt.xlabel('Distance Between Start and Target')
plt.ylabel('Success Rate')
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.show()

# ### Key Behavioral Findings:
# 
# 1. Trial Types: The dataset contains mostly MNAV (mental navigation) trials where the track was fully occluded, with fewer NTS trials where the track was visible.
# 2. Success Rates: Performance was better in NTS trials (~80% success) compared to MNAV trials (~58% success).
# 3. Distance Effect: Success rates decreased as the distance between start and target landmarks increased, suggesting the task becomes more challenging with longer mental navigation distances.

# ## Neural Data Analysis
#
# The dataset includes neural recordings from electrodes in the posterior parietal cortex. Let's examine the neural data:

# %%
# Get neural data
units = nwb.processing["ecephys"]["units"]
electrodes = nwb.electrodes

# Plot electrode locations
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
x_pos = electrodes["rel_x"].data[:]
y_pos = electrodes["rel_y"].data[:]
plt.scatter(x_pos, y_pos)
plt.title('Electrode Locations')
plt.xlabel('Relative X Position')
plt.ylabel('Relative Y Position')
plt.show()

# Plot firing rate distribution
firing_rates = units["fr"].data[:]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(firing_rates, bins=20)
plt.title('Distribution of Firing Rates')
plt.xlabel('Firing Rate (Hz)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Units')
plt.show()

# Plot unit quality distribution
quality_counts = {}
for q in units["quality"].data[:]:
    if q in quality_counts:
        quality_counts[q] += 1
    else:
        quality_counts[q] = 1

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(quality_counts.keys(), quality_counts.values())
plt.title('Distribution of Unit Quality')
plt.ylabel('Number of Units')
plt.show()

# ### Neural Data Characteristics:
#
# 1. Recording Configuration:
#    - Linear electrode array spanning ~3000 Î¼m in depth
#    - 32 recording channels
#
# 2. Unit Properties:
#    - 68 isolated units
#    - Firing rates predominantly below 10 Hz
#    - Mix of unit qualities: ~25 good units, ~22 noise, ~20 multi-unit activity (MUA)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Example: Analyzing Neural Activity Around Task Events
#
# Let's examine neural activity around the go cue:

# %%
# Get spikes and trial events for a subset of trials
n_trials_to_plot = 20
trial_start_times = trials["start_time"][:n_trials_to_plot]
go_cue_times = trials["gocuettl"][:n_trials_to_plot]

# Select a few units with good firing rates
unit_indices = np.argsort(firing_rates)[-5:]  # Get 5 units with highest firing rates
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

for i, unit_idx in enumerate(unit_indices):
    spike_times = units["spike_times"][unit_idx]
    
    # Plot spikes relative to trial start
    trial_spikes = []
    trial_numbers = []
    
    for trial_num, (start_time, go_time) in enumerate(zip(trial_start_times, go_cue_times)):
        # Get spikes in 2-second window around go cue
        mask = (spike_times >= go_time - 1) & (spike_times <= go_time + 1)
        trial_spikes.extend(spike_times[mask] - go_time)
        trial_numbers.extend([trial_num] * np.sum(mask))
    
    plt.scatter(trial_spikes, np.array(trial_numbers) + i, s=1, alpha=0.5)

plt.axvline(x=0, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Go Cue')
plt.title('Spike Raster Around Go Cue')
plt.xlabel('Time from Go Cue (s)')
plt.ylabel('Trial Number')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

#
# 2. Advanced neural analyses:
#    - Population dynamics during navigation
#    - Neural encoding of distance/direction
#    - Task-related neural activity patterns
#
# 3. Neural-behavioral correlations:
#    - Relationship between neural activity and task performance
