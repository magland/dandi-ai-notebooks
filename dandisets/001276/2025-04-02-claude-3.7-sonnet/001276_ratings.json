The notebook could illustrate more comprehensively how to handle different NWB data types beyond imaging, and demonstrate more advanced data access techniques, even if specific to imaging data representation (e.g., properties associated with the imaging series). It attempts at using file paths but defaults to Lindi URLs which work. However, these attempts could have been improved to make it seamless when Lindi URL is not needed. The demonstration could have been generalized/abstracted, so users can use their own files or a different Dandiset. The notebook uses direct loading from DANDI, which is a plus.
