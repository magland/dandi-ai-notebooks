    "**Note: This notebook was AI-generated using dandi-notebook-gen and has not been fully verified. Exercise caution when interpreting the code or results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores Dandiset 001276, which contains data from experiments investigating the effect of varying burst numbers in the CANCAN electroporation protocol on cell membrane permeabilization in confluent cell monolayers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CANCAN (Canceling-field Controlled Amplitude Nanoelectroporation) protocol is designed to minimize cell damage near the electrodes while targeting cells in the center of the electrode array. This is achieved through a strategic sequence of pulses from four electrodes with progressively reduced amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Experimental Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experimental Setup**: Four-electrode array with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm\n",
    "- **Pulse Parameters**: Each pulse had a duration of 600 ns\n",
    "- **Protocol Structure**: Nine packets of pulses delivered at 0.2 MHz frequency\n",
    "- **Protocol Variations**: Protocol was repeated 1, 2, 4, or 6 times at 1 Hz frequency\n",
    "- **Imaging**: Cell monolayers were imaged for:\n",
    "  - Hoechst staining (DAPI channel) to visualize all cell nuclei\n",
    "  - YoPro-1 uptake (FITC channel) as a marker of membrane permeabilization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Explore the structure of the Dandiset\n",
    "2. Access and visualize the imaging data\n",
    "3. Analyze the spatial distribution of permeabilization\n",
    "4. Compare permeabilization patterns between different protocols\n",
    "5. Quantify permeabilization rates"

    "In this notebook, we explored Dandiset 001276, which investigated the impact of burst number variation on permeabilization distribution in cell monolayers using the CANCAN electroporation protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**: The dataset contains paired DAPI and FITC images showing cell nuclei and permeabilized cells, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spatial Distribution**: The CANCAN protocol successfully targets cells in the center of the electrode array while minimizing effects near the electrodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Burst Number Effects**: Increasing the number of bursts appears to enhance permeabilization efficiency and results in different spatial patterns of permeabilized cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quantitative Analysis**: We showed how to calculate the permeabilization rate by comparing DAPI and FITC images, finding approximately 37% permeabilization in our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis could be extended by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing permeabilization rates across all available burst numbers (1, 2, 4, and 6)\n",
    "- Analyzing the relationship between burst number and spatial distribution more systematically\n",
    "- Investigating the relationship between pulse parameters and cell viability\n",
    "- Developing automated image segmentation approaches for more accurate cell counting\n",

    "The CANCAN (Canceling-field Controlled Amplitude Nanoelectroporation) protocol is a sophisticated approach to targeted electroporation. Based on the dataset description, it works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (7.2 kV) is applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Subsequently, simultaneous 600 ns pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% are delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence is repeated 9 times at 0.2 MHz frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol is repeated 1, 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for precise spatial targeting of electroporation, making it valuable for applications requiring selective manipulation of specific regions within a cell monolayer."
