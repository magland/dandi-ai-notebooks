First I need to get the dandiset metadata using the provided dandi-notebook-gen-tools command. This will give me information about the dandiset that I can include in the notebook's introduction.

Tool: execute_command

Each single pulse in the protocol had a duration of 600 ns. The protocol consisted of nine packets of pulses delivered at a frequency of 0.2 MHz and was repeated 1, 2, 4, or 6 times at a frequency of 1 Hz.

CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous 600 ns pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode.Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290\u2013300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 \u00b5g/mL Hoechst and 1 \u00b5M YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake.

  description: Acquisition Description (Subject-Specific): Subject ID: P1_20240627_A2, Fluorescent Channel: DAPI, Phase: pre (where 'pre' indicates imaging prior to exposure and 'post' indicates imaging of the same well after exposure).  CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous 600 ns pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode.Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake.

Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290–300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst and 1 µM YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake.

The plot shows a 1000x1000 pixel region of the DAPI staining from the NWB file. I'll use the read_image tool to analyze the plot and extract relevant information that can be included in the notebook.

Tool: read_image
Params: {'path': 'tmp_scripts/dapi_subset.png', 'instructions': 'Please analyze the DAPI staining plot and provide:\n1. A description of what is visible in the image\n2. Any notable patterns or features in the cell distribution\n3. The intensity range and distribution\n4. Whether the plot appears to show valid biological data\n5. Any artifacts or issues visible in the image'}

read_image for 'tmp_scripts/dapi_subset.png':
The image for tmp_scripts/dapi_subset.png is attached. AI description: Since you haven't provided the actual DAPI staining plot image, I'll outline a general analysis based on typical DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining data.  

1. **Description**: A DAPI staining plot typically shows nuclei (blue fluorescence) with DAPI binding to DNA, highlighting nuclear morphology and distribution.  

2. **Patterns/Features**:  
   - Expect uniform nuclear staining in healthy cells, with evenly distributed intensities.  
   - Clustering may indicate cell confluency or aggregation.  
   - Irregular shapes or fragmented nuclei suggest apoptosis or cell death.  

3. **Intensity Range & Distribution**:  
   - Healthy samples show a tight, unimodal intensity distribution.  
   - Broad or multi-peak distributions may indicate cell cycle stages (G1, S, G2/M) or debris.  

4. **Valid Biological Data?**  
   - Yes, if nuclei are intact and intensities are within expected ranges (~300–20,000 AU depending on exposure).  
   - No, if excessive background, irregular shapes, or abnormal clustering suggest artifacts.  

5. **Artifacts/Issues**:  
   - Over/under-exposure (saturated or dim nuclei).  
   - Background fluorescence (improper washing).  
   - Out-of-focus areas (blurry nuclei).  
   - Non-specific staining or debris (small, irregular signals).  

For precise feedback, upload the actual image.
