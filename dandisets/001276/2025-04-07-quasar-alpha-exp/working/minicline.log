The first step is retrieving the Dandiset metadata using the `dandi-notebook-gen-tools dandiset-info 001276` command. This is crucial for forming the introductory part of the notebook and for understanding the dataset content and context before proceeding.

This command only queries metadata and has no side effectsâ€”it is a standard introspection call, so it does not require explicit approval. I will run it with no timeout limit specified, as metadata fetches are generally quick.

Once I have the metadata, I'll analyze it and continue with asset retrieval afterward.

The Dandiset contains 108 NWB files, all relatively large (350MB to ~480MB). 
Example asset:
- `"asset_id": "95141d7a-82aa-4552-940a-1438a430a0d7"`

For the analysis, I'll pick this first asset to focus on:  
`https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/95141d7a-82aa-4552-940a-1438a430a0d7/download/`.

Next, I'll retrieve instructions and info for this NWB file via the tool:  
`dandi-notebook-gen-tools nwb-file-info 001276 https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/assets/95141d7a-82aa-4552-940a-1438a430a0d7/download/`  
This will tell me how to properly load and use it.

Running this should have no side effects.

CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous 600 ns pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode.Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290\u2013300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 \u00b5g/mL Hoechst and 1 \u00b5M YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake.

CanCan protocol (with canceling pulses),011: Protocol consisted of 9 packets of pulses delivered at 0.2MHz frequency, protocol repeated 2 times at 1Hz frequency. General Protocol Description (Subject-Independent): Experiments were conducted using a four-electrode stainless steel setup with an inter-electrode distance of 10.0 mm. The CanCan exposure protocol involved delivering packets of 600 ns pulses from four electrodes. Initially, a single 600 ns pulse (7.2 kV) was applied from one electrode (e.g., electrode 1), constituting phase 1. Subsequently, simultaneous 600 ns pulses with an amplitude reduced by 12.5% were delivered from two electrodes (e.g., electrodes 2 and 4), followed by another set of simultaneous pulses with an additional 12.5% amplitude reduction from electrodes 1 and 3. These simultaneous pulses represented phases 2, 3, and continued up to phase 8, with the amplitude reduced by 12.5% at each phase. After completing one packet of pulses, the sequence was repeated 9 times at a defined frequency. Upon completing these 9 repetitions, the protocol was either repeated 2, 4, or 6 times at a 1 Hz frequency or initiated anew from another electrode (e.g., electrode 2), ensuring that all four electrodes eventually served as the initiating electrode.Control protocols followed identical frequency and repetition schemes but lacked the subsequent, reduced-amplitude pulses delivered from the other electrodes. Before exposure, the growth medium was replaced with a physiological solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 10 D-glucose, and 10 HEPES; pH 7.3, 290\u2013300 mOsm/kg) containing 1 \u00b5g/mL Hoechst and 1 \u00b5M YoPro-1 (YP). Hoechst, visualized via the DAPI channel, stained the nuclei of all cells. YP, visualized via the FITC channel, served as a semi-quantitative marker of membrane permeabilization induced by electroporation, as it has limited permeability into intact cells. Thirty minutes post-exposure, the dye-containing solution was replaced with dye-free physiological solution, and the monolayer was imaged to assess YP uptake.

I obtained detailed instructions and metadata about the NWB file:

- Use **lindi** to access the file:
```python
f = lindi.LindiH5pyFile.from_lindi_file("https://lindi.neurosift.org/dandi/dandisets/001276/assets/95141d7a-82aa-4552-940a-1438a430a0d7/nwb.lindi.json")
nwb = pynwb.NWBHDF5IO(file=f, mode='r').read()
```

- The file contains OME-TIFF image data (fluorescence microscopy) on a **confluent cell monolayer**, imaged in the **DAPI channel** for nuclei and **FITC channel** (YoPro-1) as a permeabilization indicator.
- The primary acquisition data is in `nwb.acquisition["SingleTimePointImaging"]`.
  - The image shape is **19190 x 19190 pixels** (very large), with fluorescence intensities.

Before drafting the notebook, the instructions say to perform exploratory research using standalone python scripts, saving plots as PNGs, and analyzing them to be able to describe the data and decide what to include.

I will:
- Create a `tmp_scripts` directory (if it doesn't already exist).
- Create a Python script that loads a small subset (a crop) from `SingleTimePointImaging` in the NWB.
- Generate a downsampled preview or central crop to visualize typical image content.
- Save the plot as PNG inside `tmp_scripts`.
- Review the image output with `read_image` to understand if it's informative.

Since the size is huge (19190x19190), only a subset will be loaded, perhaps a 1000x1000 center crop.

Step 1: create the exploratory script with comments stating what it does.

I created the exploratory script `tmp_scripts/preview_image.py` which crops and saves a 1000x1000 central region from the huge microscopy image. The next step is to execute this script and generate the preview image at `tmp_scripts/sample_image_preview.png`.

Due to large file size, we'll allow up to 90 seconds as per guidance.

I will run the script now with timeout 90 seconds.

The error is:  
`ValueError: 4 indexing arguments for 3 dimensions`  
indicating that the dataset accessed by `data = img_series.data` actually has **3 dimensions**, but my code assumed 4 (as in T, C, Y, X).

Per the OME and NWB metadata, the image is 2D (single Z, single T, and possibly single-channel flattened). It's common for such images to be stored as (C, Y, X) or (Y, X) or (Z, Y, X).

I need to inspect the dimensionality of `img_series.data` before indexing. I will update the script to print its shape before cropping, and adjust cropping accordingly.  
I will write the new script version with proper shape introspection, then rerun.

The script ran successfully. The dataset has shape `(1, 19190, 19190)`, i.e., single channel, 2D image of size ~19K x 19K pixels, matching earlier metadata.

The plot file `tmp_scripts/sample_image_preview.png` was generated containing a 1000x1000 central crop.  
I will now review this image with `read_image` to summarize its content.

I will instruct the review to pay attention to:
- image quality,
- presence of fluorescence-stained nuclei,
- any obvious patterns or features,
avoiding overinterpretation beyond apparent visual content.

Tool: read_image

read_image for 'tmp_scripts/sample_image_preview.png':
The image for tmp_scripts/sample_image_preview.png is attached. AI description: The fluorescence image crop shows sparse, punctate bright spots consistent with stained nuclei or subcellular features amid a dim, heterogeneous background. Cell density appears low, with roughly 50-70 discrete spots visible. Signal intensity is strong for puncta but background is noisy and somewhat granular. No obvious imaging artifacts (e.g., striping, bleaching) are present. Due to sparse labeling and background noise, this may not be the most illustrative example for a tutorial unless demonstrating low-density samples or background correction.

The image shows sparse, punctate nuclear features amidst low but noisy background fluorescence, consistent with DAPI staining. Cell density is low in this central region, and there are no obvious artifacts, but the sparse fluorescence and background granularity may make this less ideal for a representative example in a tutorial.

I will still include this preview in the notebook, along with notes highlighting the sparse labeling observed, and suggest users may want to explore areas with denser cell labeling.

Next step:  
Begin drafting `notebook.py` with an introduction, metadata, dataset listing, loading an NWB file, central crop visualization, and guided comments.

I need to carefully author educational markdown and code per instructions, including:
- prominent AI generation disclaimer,
- dataset metadata,
- how to access listing via the DANDI API,
- image visualization instructions (cropping, caution about data size),
- results of exploratory analyses (this image preview).

I'll create the entire `notebook.py` Jupytext notebook now.
