# # Parkinson's Electrophysiological Signal Dataset (PESD) Exploration
#
# *This notebook was AI-generated with `dandi-notebook-gen` and has not been fully verified. Please use caution when interpreting results or code.*
#
# This notebook provides an introductory exploration of Dandiset **001333**, which contains electrophysiological signals from both healthy and Parkinsonian subjects.
#
# It demonstrates how to access the data, inspect its structure, and visualize beta band neural activity extracted from the subthalamic nucleus (STN).
# 
# The dataset includes:
# - **Beta Average Rectified Voltage (ARV)**: reflecting power in the beta frequency range
# - **Local Field Potentials (LFPs)**: raw synchronized neural signals
#
# For details, see: [Dataset Citation](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/001333/draft)

# ## Download or Access a Sample NWB File
# This example uses one NWB file -
# `sub-healthy-simulated-beta/sub-healthy-simulated-beta_ses-1044_ecephys.nwb`
#
# You can download it from DANDI manually, or via the DANDI API.
# Here, we use a pre-downloaded local file.

# %%
# Local path to an example NWB file (already downloaded for this notebook)
nwb_file_path = "tmp_scripts/sample_file.nwb"

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inspect the NWB File Structure
# This illustrates how to open NWB files using `h5py` (for quick structural review).
#
# **Note:** For larger scale analysis or higher-level operations, consider using `pynwb`.

# %%
import h5py

with h5py.File(nwb_file_path, "r") as f:
    print("Top-level groups:")
    for key in f.keys():
        print(f" - {key}")

    if 'processing' in f:
        print("\nProcessing modules:")
        for proc_name in f['processing'].keys():
            print(f" - {proc_name}")

# ## Extract and Plot Beta Band Voltage Data
#
# The following code extracts beta band power data from the sample file and visualizes it over time.

# %%
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

with h5py.File(nwb_file_path, "r") as f:
    group = f["processing"]["ecephys"]["LFP"]["Beta_Band_Voltage"]
    data = group["data"][:]            
    timestamps = group["timestamps"][:]
    electrodes = group["electrodes"][:]

if data.ndim == 1 and electrodes.shape[0] > 1:
    try:
        data = data.reshape((electrodes.shape[0], -1))
    except:
        data = data.reshape((1, -1))
elif data.ndim == 1:
    data = data.reshape((1, -1))

plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
for i, elec_id in enumerate(electrodes):
    if i >= data.shape[0]:
        break
    plt.plot(timestamps, data[i], label=f'Electrode {elec_id}')
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Beta Band Power (a.u.)")
plt.title("Beta Band Voltage signals across electrodes")

# The above plot demonstrates oscillatory beta activity in STN signals from the sample data.
# This kind of visualization aids in understanding neural dynamics relevant to Parkinson's symptoms.
#
# The signals correspond to beta band envelope fluctuations, typically centered ~13-30 Hz, computed via ARV metrics from LFPs.

# ## Next Steps & Advanced Analysis
# Depending on your analysis goals, additional steps might include:
# - Loading raw LFP signals for spectral analysis
# - Comparing Parkinsonian vs. control subject signals
# - Analyzing beta coherence between brain regions
# - Statistical testing of oscillatory changes under different conditions
#
# Due to computational requirements, these advanced analyses are beyond this demo notebookâ€™s scope.

# ## Summary
# This Jupytext notebook explored:
# - Accessing the metadata and assets of Dandiset 001333
# - Loading an example NWB file containing beta oscillation metrics
# - Visualizing beta band power envelope data
#
# You can extend these examples to incorporate additional files, perform more complex analyses, and customize visualization to your study objectives.
